get todo stuff for this project that is in Pop-Diffusion

put instructions to set up C RIFE next to it in the code

a way to skip right to final video stuff but have the variables that we need to have

NEW ORGANIZATION SYSTEM:
  post-production stuff options:
    1) a whole new post-production notebook
    2) a group of cells that get copy pasted into the end of new DD versions
        make a list of stuff that must be added in before the post-production cells
  intertwined stuff:
    1) guided zoom
    2) object detection
    3) antarctic prompts
    4) videoframe interpolation
    THE Fisrt 3 of these would all be great with some sort of live settings updating

Gists should be saved to text files
